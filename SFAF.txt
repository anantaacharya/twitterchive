339759216040501249  May 29 11:04  @digitalbio       So far - only a handful of mutations in cancers give actionable information with regard to drugs - rapid PCR can diagnose #SFAF

339767086521921538  May 29 11:36  @digitalbio       #SFAF - oyster project  work from Natalia Reyero - What can Next Gen Sequencing tell us about the biosphere - ex: effects of oil on oysters?
339767695102853120  May 29 11:38  @digitalbio       #SFAF oysters are a multibillion dollar part of food industry, they clean water, act as "canaries in the coal mine" for ocean ecosystems
339768056312127488  May 29 11:39  @digitalbio       Smith:  Oysters were sampled pre and post spill, high in the ground (more O2) & lower (less O2) #SFAF
339768337389219840  May 29 11:40  @digitalbio       Oyster enzymes convert hydrocarbons from oil into compounds that can intercalate into DNA #SFAF
339768678230933505  May 29 11:42  @digitalbio       RNA extracted from oyster gills > made cDNA libraries > used Illumina HiSeq & MiSeq > GeneSifter to look at expression #SFAF
339768906728214528  May 29 11:43  @digitalbio       Problem - how to annotate reads without a reference genome? The Atlantic Oyster genome hasn't been sequenced yet. #SFAF
339769274182823936  May 29 11:44  @digitalbio       The genomes of Pacific Oysters and Atlantic Oysters are pretty different - causes challenges with annotation, only 10% of RNAs mapped #SFAF
339769526419865600  May 29 11:45  @digitalbio       Oyster annotation:  Got better results by assembling transcripts and using blastx & Swissprot to identify #SFAF
339770556498993152  May 29 11:49  @digitalbio       Differential patterns of gene expression observed  ex: AhR (Aryl hydrocarbon receptor) gene stays expressed in presence of oil, low O2 #SFAF
339770935164936193  May 29 11:51  @aphillippy       #SFAF T. Smith presenting evidence of differential expression in oysters pre and post horizon oil spill, used Trinity for transcript asm
339771048671199232  May 29 11:51  @digitalbio       Longer reads & paired reads provide better tools for annotation with non-model organisms & those with missing reference genomes #SFAF

339804631024672768  May 29 14:05  @aphillippy       #SFAF good point from the audience: short reads add a hidden informatics cost (depending on application), longer reads easier to handle
