339767695102853120  May 29 11:38  @digitalbio       #SFAF oysters are a multibillion dollar part of food industry, they clean water, act as "canaries in the coal mine" for ocean ecosystems
339768056312127488  May 29 11:39  @digitalbio       Smith:  Oysters were sampled pre and post spill, high in the ground (more O2) & lower (less O2) #SFAF
339768337389219840  May 29 11:40  @digitalbio       Oyster enzymes convert hydrocarbons from oil into compounds that can intercalate into DNA #SFAF

339768906728214528  May 29 11:43  @digitalbio       Problem - how to annotate reads without a reference genome? The Atlantic Oyster genome hasn't been sequenced yet. #SFAF
339769274182823936  May 29 11:44  @digitalbio       The genomes of Pacific Oysters and Atlantic Oysters are pretty different - causes challenges with annotation, only 10% of RNAs mapped #SFAF
339769526419865600  May 29 11:45  @digitalbio       Oyster annotation:  Got better results by assembling transcripts and using blastx & Swissprot to identify #SFAF
